# Scaffold

Scaffold is a program to identify the topics mentioned in a piece of journalism as well as interpreting and presenting which lines contain  data points, quotations, dates and/or times. 

Goals for Current Version
-------------------------

A user will input a piece of journalistic text via a plaintext document and be able to view the following in a plaintext output file:

- names of people and locations mentioned in the text with relevent line numbers cited
- lines in the text containing specific dates, times, days, months, or years
- lines containing quotations
- lines containg "data points": quantitative statements and figures occuring in the text

Purpose
------
Scaffold is intended to help users that are gathering information on a topic and therefore need to consume, and later reference, many text articles. 

Oftentimes, the headline and search-result summary of an article does not inform a potential reader as to whether its content is relevent or new. Scaffold seeks to optimize the user's research time by aiding in the decision of which articles are worth their time to read.

Furthermore, Scaffold can be utilized if the user is composing a presentation or essay on the topic being researched. The Scaffold file is an easy way to find supporting quotes, events, and statistics as well as being a way to check the spelling of the proper nouns mentioned in the article.

Non-goals
-----------
Scaffold is not designed to summarize the text, elucidate the purpose of a text, or replace reading the full text of an article.
